              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS2</a> is a shooter
              game which contains a case opening system. I found it quite interesting and wanted to try and recreate the case opening system myself.
              <br></br>
              There are 10 different cases that can be opened with the same odds as CS2's case opening system.
              I made everything very simular to CS2 by making the UI, skins and cases look the same.
              <br></br>
              In this simulator you can choose which case you want to open and you can then buy keys for it.
              After unlocking the case you'll get a roll animation which will then end up on your winning skin.
              <br></br>
              <b>How does it work?</b>
              <br></br>
              Upon unlocking the case 50 weapon showcases will spawn, which each contain a random skin.
              Every weapon showcase will move towards the left and there is a winline in the middle, whatever skin lands on it will be the winning showcase.
              The closer the winning showcase is from the winline, the less speed it will have moving left. 
              Once the winning showcase is on the winline, it will slowly stop moving.
              The winning showcase has already been determined from the moment you open the case, just like CS2's case openings / gambling in general.
              <br></br>
              I used scriptable objects and prefabs to create an easy way to change what case is selected and opened.
              <br>
              It's also very easy for me to add new cases and skins to the project because of the efficient use of scriptable objects.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>User Interface</i>
              <br></br>
              I took the UI very seriously this project and wanted it to look amazing and work perfectly.
              My goal was to make the UI the same as CS2's layout and color scheme.  
              This project has the best UI I've ever made before, it's easy to navigate and looks very good. 
              <br></br>
              <i>Everything I wanted to add initially</i>
              <br></br>
              At the start of the project I planned out a lot of features to add.
              The following features I never ended up adding, but would be very cool additions to the game: <br></br>
              - Inventory system that saves what skins you've won in the skins inventory tab <br>
              - A level system which unlocks a new case each level, opening cases grants xp <br>
              - Daily special cases which unlock depending on your level <br>
              - Inventory saves with PlayerPrefs (skins, keys and level) <br>
              - You can select skins to bet in the upgrader. To upgrade a skin's value you can choose a percentage to hit, the lower the percentage is, the more the skin will be upgraded.
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              CS2 Case Simulator took me 2 months to make in Unity and you can play it on Windows.
