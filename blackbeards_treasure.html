              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Blackbeards Treasure is inspired by Angry Birds and takes place in the pirates era.
              The environment is destructible and there are powerup circles that can upgrade your cannonballs.
              <br></br>
              Can you succesfully defeat the pirates and claim Blackbeards treasure?
              <br></br>
              <b>Exam Project</b>
              <br></br>
              For this exam I have to design and create a game in 1 week (40 hours) while managing a structured backlog/planning, daily standups & sprints, playtesting, clean code and assets.
              <br></br>
              I started with creating a <a href="https://jmp.sh/kETDp2BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>GDD</i></a> (game design document) which contains everything about the game, including sprints, sprint reviews, playtesting and a retroperspective.
              <br></br>
              After the GDD, I created a <a href="https://jmp.sh/RAWfCvLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>TDD</i></a> (technical design document) where I explain how I'm going to code everything.
              <br></br>
              During the exam I held daily standups with my project supervisor and let others playtest everytime I finished a task, which gave me valuable feedback on what could be improved.
              <br></br>
              I had 2 sprints in total (5 days for both combined) and used <a href="https://imgur.com/a/blackbeards-treasure-trello-showcase-OZnZdIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Trello</i></a> to plan everything.
              <br></br>
              <b>What did I learn?</b>
              <br></br>
              <i>Creating my own assets</i>
              <br></br>
              For this project I <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9TZnrQZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>drew my own assets</i></a>, which I've never done before for other projects.
              <br>
              I used <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>paint.net</i></a> to draw the assets, which all turned out great.
              The reason I created the assets myself is because I got bored of looking at the default squares and circles. 
              <br>
              At first I thought it was a bad priority to take, but I still managed to finish everything I planned in my sprints.
              <br></br>
              <i>Working with a structured backlog & planning</i>
              <br></br>
              Because I only had 40 hours to work on this project, I had to plan all my tasks into sprints and figure out how to code everything ahead of time in the <a href="https://jmp.sh/RAWfCvLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>TDD</i></a>.
              <br></br>
              I handled the entire project very professionally with how I planned and documented everything. I worked hard during the 40 hours of development and I’m really proud of what I’ve managed to get done.
              <br></br>
              <b>Other Information</b>
              <br></br>
              Blackbeards Treasure took me 5 days to make in Unity and you can play it on Windows.
