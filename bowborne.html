              <b>What's the game about?</b>
              <br></br>
              Bowborne is made as an intake assignment for Breda University of Applied Sciences and is made in C++ with <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>SFML</i></a> and <a href="https://box2d.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Box2D</i></a>.
              <br></br>
              The goal of Bowborne is to shoot the enemy off the platform, but you have limited arrows so you must carefully shoot them towards the enemy.
              <br></br>
              How high of a score can you get?  
              <br></br>
              <b>First time using C++</b>
              <br></br>
              The requirements of the intake were to create a game in C++ with the theme 'Collide' without using a game engine.
              <br></br>
              To get started I watched some youtube videos to get more general familiarity with C++ and would learn the basics like how to 
              make an image render and move, how to make basic collisions, how to create and modify text, etc.
              <br></br>
              I mainly looked things up and checked out the top results, which are websites like Stack Overflow, cppreference and W3Schools. 
              The documentation websites about SFML and Box2D helped out a ton to learn more about it and to fix problems I had with it. 
              <br></br>
              Maybe in a year I will probably think this code looks horrible and that it could be improved in every way, but 
              for now it works and I learned a lot along the way of creating this game.
              <br></br>
              <b>Using Box2D</b>
              <br></br>
              To create collisions and physics for my objects I used Box2D, which is also used in Unity for their colliders and physics.
              The <a href="https://box2d.org/documentation/hello.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Hello Box2D</i></a> 
              documentation helped me get started on creating my world and how to create dynamic body's that can interact with each other.
              <br></br>
              Creating a decent arrow mechanic was the hardest thing I created during the entire project, because 
              it was hard to simulate exactly how a real arrow would behave.
              <br></br>
              Upon spawning an arrow I applied a force to the tip of the arrow to launch it forwards.
              It didnt rotate how I wanted it to, so I applied a constant small drag to the back of the arrow to 
              simulate how an arrow would fall and rotate.

              during development.
